# Description

> The name EurekaQuery is still up for debate - please see below some suggestions in the 'Ideas for naming from ChatGPT' section

The **EurekaQuery** project aims to enhance the accessibility and analysis of scientific literature. By integrating Flask as the web framework and leveraging the OpenAI API, the platform specializes in transforming research questions, stated in natural language, into structured PubMed queries. **EurekaQuery** is designed to make scientific discoveries more accessible, catering to a wide audience, from seasoned researchers to those new to medical research.

The core functionality of **EurekaQuery** revolves around the use of natural language processing (NLP) to dissect and understand research questions. However, its application is specifically tailored to analyze the structure of these questions based on the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework, a method commonly used in evidence-based practice to formulate clinical and health-related questions. This focused application of NLP ensures that queries are generated with precision, directly reflecting the user's intent and the specific elements of their research inquiry.

Once a query is crafted and executed on PubMed, **QuestBridge** adopts a deterministic approach to analyze the search results and systematically organize the data into a dashboard. This dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of the research landscape related to the query, including key metrics, trends, and insights drawn from the retrieved literature. It is designed to give users a clear and concise overview of the available evidence.
